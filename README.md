### Personal Learnings 

For this project I enjoyed that we got to take a break from style heavy sites such as Inhabitent, and that we got the chance to focus more on the ajax, php and jQuery side of development. It was interesting to learn more about WordPress, and become more familiar with how it works and template heirarchy. I'm lookig forward to expanding on this learning process and becoming more comfortabel with it as a cms.
